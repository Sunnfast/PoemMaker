Program can:

1) Give the user instructions to enter a poem one line at a time. 
2) The instruction includes a way to end the loop.
3) Created a user - controlled loop that gets one line of the user's input and concatenates it to a string variable each time through the loop.  
4) Remember to include the endline character (std::endl or "\n"). Note: You must do this in a loop that gets only one line from the user in the body of the loop.
